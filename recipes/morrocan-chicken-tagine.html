      <p>
        Moroccan chicken tagine is a traditional North African stew made with
        chicken, aromatic spices (such as cumin, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, and
        saffron), onions, garlic, preserved lemons, olives, and sometimes dried
        fruits like apricots or raisins. The dish is slow-cooked in a tagine (a
        conical clay pot) or a heavy pot, resulting in tender, flavorful chicken
        with a rich, fragrant sauce. It is often served with couscous or bread.

      </ul>
      <h3>Tagine</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion (diced)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 cup pitted green olives (halved)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>
        Combine saffron threads with boiling hot chicken broth or water in a
        small bowl; steep until cooled to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>
        Cut preserved lemon into quarters. Use a small knife to trim the flesh
        from the peel. Remove and discard any seeds, and finely chop the flesh.
        Transfer into a small bowl; reserve until needed. Slice each piece of
        peel in half to make 8 strips total; reserve until needed.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>
        To prepare chicken for marinating, make 2 cuts into the skin side of
        each thigh, down to the bone, about 1 inch apart. Transfer chicken into
        a resealable plastic bag; place bag in a bowl to catch any leakage.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>
        For marinade, add finely chopped preserved lemon flesh into a bowl; add
        garlic, salt, black pepper, paprika, cumin, ginger, Aleppo chili flakes,
        parsley, cilantro, and olive oil. Pour in steeped saffron liquid, and
        whisk thoroughly until emulsified.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <p>
        Pour marinade into the bag of chicken thighs. Massage chicken with your
        hands on the outside of the bag until evenly coated with marinade.
        Squeeze out any air and seal the bag tightly. Marinate in the
        refrigerator for 3 to 12 hours, turning bag over and massaging
        occasionally.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <p>
        Carefully remove chicken thighs to a plate, and scrape any excess
        marinade back into the bag while doing so. Reserve excess marinade for
        sauce.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <p>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat in a heavy-duty
        braising pan, or other type of pan with a tight-fitting lid. Once hot,
        place the chicken in, skin side down. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until
        the skin is browned, and fat has rendered. The skin may stick and tear,
        but that will not affect the final dish. Turn off heat; remove chicken
        to a plate and reserve.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 8</h3>
      <p>
        Turn heat back up to medium-high, and add onion, salt, cinnamon, and
        turmeric to the pan. Cook, stirring for a few minutes, or until onions
        turn translucent and start to soften. Place chicken thighs back in, skin
        side up, and pour over any juices from the plate. Distribute the
        reserved excess marinade over the top of chicken.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 9</h3>
      <p>
        As soon as juices in the bottom of the pan start to bubble, cover
        tightly, and reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, for 1 hour.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 10</h3>
      <p>
        Uncover pan, and baste chicken with cooking liquid. Scatter green olives
        and reserved lemon peel over the top, and baste again.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 11</h3>
      <p>
        Cover; cook until chicken is very tender and will easily pull away from
        the bone, 15 to 20 minutes more.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 12</h3>
      <p>
        Raise heat up to medium-high, and cook, uncovered, to reduce the cooking
        liquid until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. The sauce can be left
        thin and brothy, or cooked further to reduce to a glaze, or anywhere in
        between.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 13</h3>
      <p>
        Garnish with fresh parsley, cilantro sprigs, and another dusting of
        chili flakes.
